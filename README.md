#### VERY IMPORTANT : Read the AI_Project_Summary PDF file in order to understand the inner workings of this project.

#### Summary:
A project which revolves around finding optimal cost path in a grid with a given start and end points using both informed and uninformed search algorithms with some squares in the grid that are a dead end and has a value of -1. The algorithms used in
this project are Iterative Deepining Search (IDS) , Uniform Cost Search (UCS) , A* (ASTAR) , Iterative Deepining A* (IDASTAR) , Bidirectional A* (BIASTAR).
Tests files and their results are in the 'Tests' folder.

UPDATE: Code is tested and working 100% In order to run the program download the AISearchProject.exe file and follow these steps :

1. Open the AISearchProject executable file.

2. Paste the absolute address of txt input file from your your PC ( Example input files exist in the Tests folder ).

3. Enter a positive number in order to determine the time limit for the search algorithm to run under.

4. Results will be displayed on screen.

5. Press 0 to exit the program.

Peace !!!
